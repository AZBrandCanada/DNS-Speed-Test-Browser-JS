# DNS Test Web Browser (Client-Side)

This is a lightweight, **client-side** web tool that lets you check DNS resolution results directly in your browser. No data is sent to any server — everything runs locally.

## 🔒 Privacy First

- No tracking  
- No cookies  
- No logging  
- 100% client-side  

Your DNS test data **never leaves your browser**.

## 📂 How It Works

The HTML file uses JavaScript to test if a domain name resolves by attempting to load an image from the domain. If the browser can reach it, it's marked as "Available." If not, it's "Unavailable."

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Test DNS propagation when moving websites  
- Quickly verify DNS setup without external tools  

## 📁 Usage

Just open `DNSTEST.html` in any modern web browser.

Or host it yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AZBrandCanada/DNS-Test-Web-Browser-JS.git
